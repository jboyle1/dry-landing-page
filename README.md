## Name of Project: Jackie Summerfield Ceramics (website)

This application was my final major project at university. It was exhibited at the New Designers awards with the business 
design center in Islington. A great experience and good practise in self promotion. The DRY app gives alcoholics hope of 
recovery through a tried and tested system. it provides a twelve step guide available to all. It is also for people 
apprehensive about group therapy and/or uneasy about the religious bias that traditional organisations like Alcoholics 
Anonymous carry.
